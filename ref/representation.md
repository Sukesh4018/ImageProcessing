<p> Image Representation </p>
An Image is a 2-dimensional <b>Continous</b> object with each point can will have certain value of attribute generally this attribute is <b>Intensity</b>. We deal with gray scale initially to get an understanding and then move to color scale images.
Grayscale image is image which has colors Black and White. Image is a continous object, but in real cases all the devices are descrete. so to study an Image we have to divide it into fixed parts namely pixels

Pixel: Smallest addressable point in a display device. Pixel is assigned an intensity value for representing the image.
Similar to spatial discretisation, Intensity discretisation is also needed as intensity is continous in nature but we cannot represent all the intensities in display device.

Initially Only black and white just two levels of intensity then it is increased in multiples of two now a days 0-255 levels are used to represent intensity

Similarly for a color Image Red, Green and Blue are seen as three independent intensity levels. (R, G, B) each ranging from 0-255 these are independent as R, G, B are suffiecient to span all colors
